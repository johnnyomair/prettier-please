# prettier-please [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A CLI tool to setup Prettier and pre-commit hooks. Heavily inspired by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Execute in the root directory of your project:

```bash
npx prettier-please
```

Installs [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier), [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) and [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged).

Feedback is welcome 🙏
